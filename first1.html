    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prenatal Care:</strong> Schedule and attend regular prenatal check-ups with a healthcare provider who specializes in prenatal care (obstetrician, gynecologist, or midwife).</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Maintain a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and dairy products. Avoid raw or undercooked meats, fish high in mercury, unpasteurized dairy products, and excessive caffeine.</li>
        <li><strong>Supplements:</strong> Take prenatal vitamins containing folic acid (at least 400-800 mcg per day) as recommended by your healthcare provider to prevent neural tube defects.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Harmful Substances:</strong> Quit smoking and avoid alcohol and recreational drugs. Limit exposure to environmental toxins and chemicals.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Consult with your healthcare provider before taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to ensure they are safe during pregnancy.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Engage in regular, moderate exercise as advised by your healthcare provider. Avoid activities that carry a high risk of falling or injury.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Get plenty of rest and sleep to support your body as it undergoes changes during pregnancy.</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional Well-being:</strong> Manage stress through relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, yoga, or meditation. Seek support from loved ones or consider joining prenatal classes or support groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Symptoms:</strong> Be aware of any unusual symptoms such as severe nausea and vomiting (hyperemesis gravidarum), severe abdominal pain, or bleeding, and report them promptly to your healthcare provider.</li>
